### 🧑‍💻 About Me  

I’m Victory, a frontend developer with a strong design eye, building modern web experiences for ** real estate brands, architectural studios, and property-focused businesses.**

I work across custom development and tools like React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Webflow, and Framer to create websites and platforms that feel clear, calm, and intentional — built to support trust, storytelling, and conversion.

Currently building at Vicante Web Designs, where I help property brands turn ideas into digital experiences that match the quality of what they offer.

Great websites aren’t decoration — they’re direction.
